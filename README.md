# HatespeechClassification
This is a machine learning project on classifying hate speech on twitter. It uses Python and several Python libraries.

The project is a Jupyter Notebook, since it's more of a data science project. It uses the following libraries:
- nltk
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn

The Notebook can be opened directly within Github, where it has the outputs that I got when running it before uploading it.
It can also be forked/downloaded, so that the user can run it for themselves.

It has a problem that it didn't have when I handed it in as a school project half a year ago. The algorithms
(mainly SVM) have problems with the number of iterations they can do. I tried increasing these,
but it didn't fix most of them. Due to the amount of time it already takes them to get to these
limits, I didn't increase them any further. There are still outputted results that can be worked with,
so I worked with them.
